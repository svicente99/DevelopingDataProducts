<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<div>
   <ul>
	<li>First, you need to fill normal distribution parameters: mean and standard deviation.</li> 
	<li>After, you may inform to the App 
	  lower and upper area limits you want to obtain probability value of your Normal variable.<br/>
 	By default it's set between -1 e +1 standard deviation 
	(sigma). Modify them according your case, using the slider control.</li>
	<br/>
	<li>If you need to calculate the probability of standardized Normal, just click on <var>"Normal 0-1"</var> check box. The App will change
	"mean" to 0 and "sigma" to 1. (The limits will show 68,27%, that it is area under -1 e +1 sigma.)</li>

	<li>To obtain the probability of only one side of the curve:<br/> <var> P[ X&gt;x ]</var> or <var>P[ X&lt;x ] </var><br/>
	just slide one of the arrows to left or right outbound.</li>
   </ul>
</div>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<div>
   <ul>
	<li>My insight to write this application was to aid my students (College and free Statistics courses) to comprehend Normal distribution, your general form and the
Probability calculus when are given lower or upper limits (or both).<br/> Some <strong>EXAMPLES</strong> of its use can be demonstrated to solve simple problems like these:</li>
   </ul>
   <blockquote>
   <ol>
	<li>A radar unit is used to measure speed of cars on a motorway. 
The speeds are normally distributed with a mean of 90 km/hr and a standard deviation of 10 km/hr. 
What is the probability that a car picked at random is travelling at more than 100 km/hr? 
	</li>
	<li>Entry to a certain University is determined by a national test. 
The scores on this test are normally distributed with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. 
Tom wants to be admitted to this university and he knows that he must score better than at least 70% of the students 
who took the test. Tom takes the test and scores 580. Will he be admitted to this university? 
	</li>
   </ol>
   </blockquote>
   
   <ul>
   <li>SOLUTIONS:</li>
   </ul>
   <blockquote>
   <ol>
	<li>Fill <em>mu</em> and <em>sigma</em>, respectively, to 90 and 10. Slide limits to: inf=100, sup=right outbound.
   The result shows to you: 0.1587  (or P[X&gt;100].</li>
	<li>Fill <em>mu</em> and <em>sigma</em>, respectively, to 90 and 10. Slide inferior limit to left outbound (-100); and go sliding upper until
overpass 0.7. When it reaches 560, the probability is 0.7257
   Thus, Tom will be admitted. Because your score is better than 70% of the students (in fact, 580 is better than 77%).</li>
   </ol>
   </blockquote>

<h3>Features, Limitations and Evolution</h3>
<div>
   <ul>
<li>This App <span style="color:red">isn't still accepting float values</span>. It will be enhanced to manipulate them, as soon as possible.</li>
<li><strong style="color:red">Don't blank parameter values.</strong> It causes a critical error. In this case, just reload App (F5).<br/>
    (A workaround solution is being analyzed to correct this problem...)
<li>X axis extremities are bound to six sigma (to down and up).</li> 
<em>Evolution:</em>
<li>Be more precise when getting areas of only one tail of the curve. E.g., write the expression above plot as <var>P[ X&gt;x ]</var> or <var>P[ X&lt;x ]</var>.</li>
<li>Fine tuning to lower and upper limits. (The scale allows only values onto the steps.)</li>
   </ul>
